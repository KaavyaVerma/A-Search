# A-Search PathFinding Visualizer
--It is a searching algorithm that is used to find the shortest path between an initial and a final point.

--It is a handy algorithm that is often used for map traversal to find the shortest path to be taken. A* was initially designed as a graph traversal problem, to help build a robot that can find its own course. It still remains a widely popular algorithm for graph traversal.

--It searches for shorter paths first, thus making it an optimal and complete algorithm. An optimal algorithm will find the least cost outcome for a problem, while a complete algorithm finds all the possible outcomes of a problem.

--Another aspect that makes A* so powerful is the use of weighted graphs in its implementation. A weighted graph uses numbers to represent the cost of taking each path or course of action. This means that the algorithms can take the path with the least cost, and find the best route in terms of distance and time.

**Program Execution**
--Click anywhere in the grid to set the source position it will turn in orange colour.

--Click for the second time to choose the destination position anywhere in the grid it will turn in turquoise colour.

--Now click for the barriers where you want to put it will turn black.

--After setting the source, destination and the barriers hit the space button to see the magic of the algorithm.

--The algorithm stops working after getting the shortest path to reach destination from the source.

--The shortest path will be in purple colour.

--Press 'c' (without single quotes) to restart the algorithm.
